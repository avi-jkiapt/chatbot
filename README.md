A chatbot for Tourist help

Chatbots are increasingly transforming the way we interact with software. They provide a great business opportunity for both small
and large companies.
Chatbots can be defined as software agents that converse through a chat interface.Theyâ€™re software programs that are able to have a
conversation,which provides some kind of value to the end user.The user can interact with the chatbot by typing in their end of the
conversation, or simply by using their voice, depending on the type of chatbot provided.

Virtual assistants like Apple Siri or Amazon Alexa are two examples of popular chatbots interacting via voice rather than text. 

I have build this chatbot using Watson Conversation(formely Watson Assistant). This Chatbot help travellers in providing information about
travells and tours suggestion in India. 

You can use the json file in Watson Assistant to train it.The Live working of Chatbot can be seen here: https://wwwavinashkumarycom.000webhostapp.com/
